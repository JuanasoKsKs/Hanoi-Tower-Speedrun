![simulation]()

## Goal

Objective of the game is to stack all the pieces from one side to another making single moves (in the less amount of moves and time, that's why its a *speedrun*)

### Conditions for the moves
- You can move only one piece at a time
- A piece *CAN* be placed above another piece or in an empty column
- A piece can *NOT* be above a smaller piece

## Controls
You can use the LEFT, DOWN and RIGHT arrows to move between columns
A move is divided in 2 steps:
1. select the TOP piece from a column
2. select the column where you want to move it
If you want to move another piece you first need to release the one you are holding.
